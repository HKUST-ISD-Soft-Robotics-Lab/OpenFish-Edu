# OpenFish-Edu
This repository presents OpenFish-Edu, a simplified version of [OpenFish](https://osf.io/gsnc2/) used for educational purposes. The repo contains the necessary design and fabrication files for building the OpenFish-Edu, which was first used by the HKUST ISDN2400 Physical Prototyping course.

The original OpenFish project repository (https://osf.io/gsnc2/) provides the design and fabrication files needed to construct the OpenFish soft robotic fish. Comprehensive build instructions can be found in the HardwareX paper [1] titled "OpenFish: Biomimetic Design of a Soft Robotic Fish for High-Speed Locomotion."

## What is new
- OpenFish(original) -> OpenFish-Edu
    - Deleted and simplified rail component designed for adjusting wire tension. The same tensioning effect can be achieved by improving the assembly process.
    - Modify fish case part for direct installation of gearbox mechanism.
    - Modify the gearbox part to make transmission more reliable.
    - Other minor changes and bug fixes.
